    # HW3 Association Rules
    # 
    # For this homework, we are going to explore the bank data, available on the LMS, and an
    # accompanying description of the attributes and their values. The dataset contains
    # attributes on each person's demographics and banking information in order to determine
    # they will want to obtain the new PEP (Personal Equity Plan).
    # 
    # Your goal is to perform Association Rule discovery on the dataset using Weka.
    # 
    # First perform the necessary preprocessing steps required for association rule mining,
    # specifically the id field needs to be removed and a number of numeric fields need
    # discretization or otherwise converted to nominal.
    # 
    # Next perform association rule discovery on the preprocessed data. Experiment with
    # different parameters and preprocessing so that you get on the order of 20-30 strong rules,
    # e.g. rules with high lift and confidence which at the same time have relatively good
    # support. Don't forget to report in details what you have tried.
    #    
    # Finally, set PEP as the right hand side of the rules, and see what rules are generated.
    # 
    # Select the top 5 most "interesting" rules and for each specify the following:
    #   Support, Confidence and Lift values
    #   An explanation of the pattern and why you believe it is interesting based on the
    #     business objectives of the company.
    #   Any recommendations based on the discovered rule that might help the company
    #     to better understand behavior of its customers or to develop a business
    #     opportunity.
    # 
    # Note that the top 5 most interesting rules are most likely not the top 5 in the strong rules.
    # They are rules, that in addition to having high lift and confidence, also provide some non-
    #   trivial, actionable knowledge based on underlying business objectives.
    # 
    # To complete this assignment, write a short report describing your association rule mining
    # process and the resulting 5 interesting rules, each with their three items of explanation
    # and recommendations. For at least one of the rules, discuss the support, confidence and
    # lift values and how they are interpreted in this data set.
    # 
    # You should write the report as if you are working for a client who knows little about data
    # mining. Your report should give your client some insightful and reliable suggestions on
    # what kinds of potential buyers your client should contact, and convince your client that
    # your suggestions are reliable based on the evidence gathered from your experiment
    # results.
    # 
    # In more detail, your report should include:
    #   
    #   Description of preprocessing steps
    #   Description of parameters and experiments in order to obtain strong rules
    #   Give the top 5 most interesting rules and the 3 items listed above for each rule
    #   For one rule, discuss the support, confidence and lift numbers and how they were
    #     computed from the data
